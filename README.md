# Fortune_500_MiniProject_LFD

The Fortune magazine produces an annual list of the top 500 largest US companies ranked based on 
their revenue for their respective fiscal years. The Fortune data store lists make it easy to research 
and acquire the information needed to evaluate our business landscape. In this project, a 
grading scale system for Fortune 500 companies are developed with the help of a hybrid approach 
of clustering techniques.
